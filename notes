Use HSV vs RGB
	- Hue: 
	- Saturatin: how intense a color is
	- Value: how dark or how light a color is
in opencv
	- use a mask
	- binaray array that only allows specific pixels to be displayed
declare two arrays
	- [h s v]
TASK:
	- find upper and lower bound of color
	- ORANGE
	- Use mss and google 

Blurring Task notes:
	
	Denoising:
	- basic approach
		unweighted average: replacing each pixel with the avg of all the neighbors
		Assumes: 
		- pixels in a neighborhood area resemble each other (entropy of pixels is low)
		- neighboring pixels have same importance
		- noise is scattered in independed way

		weighted avg: same idea as above but some pixels have more importance
